# Urja — Intentional Inactivity Log

**Period**: 2025-12-30 to 2026-01-13 (2 Weeks)
**Status**: ⏸️ **ACTIVE**

## 🚦 Rule of Engagement
During this window, we do NOT change the core (`src/core`, `src/resolve`).
We only allow:
- ✅ Critical bug fixes (correctness)
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Preset configuration changes (non-core)

|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| 2025-12-30 | Governance Infrastructure | "I want to refactor the engine to make @internal methods truly private" | Realized that `@internal` + linting is sufficient for now. Refactoring would risk stability. | ✅ |

## 🧠 Reflection
The first day of the inactivity window has shown that the urge to "clean up" core code is strong even when not strictly necessary for functionality. The boundary is working by forcing us to justify every change against the governance rules.
