URJA CLI — PROJECT CREATION MASTER PROMPT (FINAL)
Objective

Build a minimal, opinion-free CLI command to create a new Urja project.
The CLI must ask only three questions and stop.

Urja must not manage dependencies.
Users are fully responsible for installing anything from npm.

Command
urja create <project-name>

Global Rules (STRICT)

Use interactive CLI selection (arrow keys + Enter)

Do NOT accept free-text for selections

Do NOT recommend or suggest anything

Do NOT install npm packages

Do NOT ask about package managers

Do NOT detect operating system

Do NOT add extra steps

Exit cleanly on Ctrl + C

Question Flow (LOCKED ORDER)
1️⃣ Framework Selection

Prompt

? Select framework


Options (exact order)

React
Vue
Svelte
Solid
Preact
Lit
Alpine
Mithril
Vanilla JS


Rules

User must select exactly one

No descriptions or recommendations

Selection maps directly to adapter

Config Mapping

"framework": "<selected>"

2️⃣ Language Selection

Prompt

? Select language


Options

JavaScript
TypeScript


Rules

Single selection

Determines source file extensions only

Config Mapping

"language": "js" | "ts"

3️⃣ Stylesheet Type Selection

Prompt

? Select base stylesheet type


Options

CSS
SCSS
Sass (indented)
Less


Rules

Single selection

No CSS frameworks involved

No preprocessing explanation required

Config Mapping

"styles": {
  "type": "css | scss | sass | less"
}

Completion Behavior

After the third selection:

✔ Project created


CLI must exit immediately.

Generated Files (MINIMUM)
urja.config.json
{
  "framework": "react",
  "language": "ts",
  "styles": {
    "type": "scss"
  }
}

package.json

Only core Urja scripts

Only required adapter dependency

No additional libraries

Explicit Non-Responsibilities (IMPORTANT)

Urja must NOT:

install dependencies

ask about npm / yarn / pnpm / bun

suggest libraries or tools

modify code after creation

generate extra configs

Users will install anything they want manually.

Design Philosophy (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Framework first

Config is the source of truth

Zero opinion

Zero magic

User owns their stack

Urja behaves like an infrastructure tool, not a starter kit.

🔒 STATUS: FINAL & LOCKED

This prompt is implementation-ready and should be treated as a public contract for the Urja CLI.

No further questions should be added unless a new major version is planned.

not a gimmick

This experience should communicate:

“Urja is the system everything else runs on.”
