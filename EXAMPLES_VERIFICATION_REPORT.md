# 🧪 Comprehensive Framework & Examples Verification Report

Date: 2026-01-02
Urja Version: 1.0.0-freeze (Production Grade)

## 📊 Summary
All example projects in the `examples/` directory have been verified. The build system, including the **Universal Transformer** and **Core Engine**, is functioning correctly with zero negative impact on existing framework support.

## 🛠️ Key Improvements (Production Ready)
1. **Vue 3 SFC Stability**: 
   - Improved `<script setup>` binding metadata extraction.
   - Fixed identifier collision in generated code.
   - Handled `export default` replacement more robustly.
2. **Explicit Configuration Support**:
   - Verified that `urja.config.js` is correctly manually loaded and prioritized over auto-detection.
   - Example projects now demonstrate both **Zero-Config** and **Custom Config** pathways.
3. **Framework-Specific Visuals**:
   - Updated React, Vue, and Svelte examples with framework-specific titles and interactive testers to make verification easier for users.
4. **Adapter Unification**:
   - Consolidated framework logic into the `UniversalTransformer`, removing redundant plugin registrations in the Dev Server.
